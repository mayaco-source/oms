    "In this project, I developed a Python-based Organization Management System that allows users to manage staff records for different organizational scenarios: Hospital, School, and Company. The system enables the user to perform three main tasks:\n",
    "\t1.\tDisplay current staff members and their departments.\n",
    "\t2.\tModify a staff member’s department.\n",
    "\t3.\tSearch for a staff member by name to view their details.\n",
    "\n",
    "The program also includes a main menu for navigation, where the user can select tasks and return to the menu after completing each operation. The system handles invalid inputs gracefully and provides clear error messages when necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal was to create a functional, user-friendly, and modular program to demonstrate the ability to manage and modify staff data efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python Organization Management System Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Functionality:\n",
    "\t•\tThe program meets all requirements: displays staff information modifies departments, and searches staff by name for Hospital, School, and Company scenarios.\n",
    "\t•\tTasks are implemented correctly: display, modify, and search staff data, with appropriate prompts and error messages if staff are not found.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Code Quality:\n",
    "\t•\tCode is modular and well-structured using functions for each task: display_staff(), modify_staff_department(), and search_staff_by_name().\n",
    "\t•\tEach function is named to indicate its purpose, ensuring readability and maintainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Error Handling:\n",
    "\t•\tThe program handles invalid inputs gracefully:\n",
    "\t•\tIt prompts the user again if an invalid menu option is entered.\n",
    "\t•\tIf a staff member’s name isn’t found, an error message is shown.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. User Interface:\n",
    "\t•\tThe user interface is simple and intuitive, with clear prompts and well-organized options. The program returns to the main menu after each task, allowing easy navigation between operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Comments and Documentation:\n",
    "\t•\tCode includes clear comments to explain the purpose of functions and key sections.\n",
    "\t•\tFunction documentation is concise and to the point, describing each function’s purpose and parameters.\n",
    "\n"
